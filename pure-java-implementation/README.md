# Pure Java Implementation

This folder contains the original Java implementations of the algorithms, preserved for reference and to demonstrate Java programming skills.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- **min-cost-triangulation/**: Dynamic programming solution for polygon triangulation
- **max-flow-min-cut/**: Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for maximum flow computation

## ðŸ’» Running the Java Versions

Each algorithm folder contains:
- `Main.java`: Complete algorithm implementation
- `README.md`: Detailed explanation, input/output format, and sample test cases

### Local Execution
```bash
cd pure-java-implementation/min-cost-triangulation
javac Main.java
java Main
```

### Online Execution
You can also run these algorithms online using JDoodle:
- [Min-Cost Triangulation on JDoodle](https://www.jdoodle.com/ia/1Iay)
- [Max Flow / Min Cut on JDoodle](https://www.jdoodle.com/ia/1Iax)

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

These Java implementations demonstrate:
- **Algorithm Design**: Clean, efficient implementations of classic algorithms
- **Java Programming**: Object-oriented design, data structures, and I/O handling
- **Problem Solving**: Mathematical modeling and computational thinking
- **Code Quality**: Well-documented, modular, and maintainable code

*Note: The main project now features an interactive web calculator built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. These Java implementations serve as the foundation and reference for the web version.*
