# 🧠 Algorithm Practice in Java

This repository showcases personal Java projects that implement classic algorithms from scratch. Each project emphasizes clarity, algorithmic accuracy, and usability.

## 📂 Projects

1. **Min-Cost Triangulation**  
   Computes the optimal way to triangulate a polygon such that the total squared edge lengths are minimized using dynamic programming.

2. **Max Flow / Min Cut**  
   Uses the Ford-Fulkerson method to compute the maximum flow in a directed graph and determine the min-cut.

## 📄 Subdirectory READMEs

Each project folder contains a dedicated `README.md` file with:

- A deeper explanation of the algorithm
- Input/output formatting details
- Sample inputs and outputs
- Local run instructions
